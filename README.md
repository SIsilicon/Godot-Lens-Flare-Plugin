# Godot-Lens-Flare-Plugin

Hello and thank you for using the Godot Lens Flare Plugin for Godot 3.0.

# Installation

Once you have enabled the plugin in your Godot project, you should add a new node called Lens Flare. As soon as the node is in your scene the lens flare effect should be visible in the 3d editor.
*Note* the editors flare and the flare on runtime may look a little different. In particular there brightness.

# Instructions

As you may have seen in the asset store where you may have downloaded it, the plugin's node comes with some properties to customize the effect.

- Flare Strength: Controls how strong the effect is.
- Flare Bias: Controls the filtering of bright points on the screen; which determines how much of screen will be used in the lens flare effect.
- Distortion: Controls how much colour distortion is made on the flares.
- Ghost Count: Controls how many "ghosts" appear on the screen.
- Ghost Spacing: Controls the distance between ghosts.
- Halo Width: Controls the radius of the halo.
- Lens Dirt: The texture gets modulated with the final effect making it look a little dirty. The default texture should be fine.
